## Data Analysis
Most of the analysis used should be clear in the dashboard. The main tool used was ordinary linear regression, though logistic regression is also an option that can be toggled. These were used to study the correlation between per student instructional spending and the other three variables listed above.

## Target Audience
The choropleth maps are intended for anyone, hopefully providing a visually interesting way to see the distribution of the different variables used.

The scatter plot and regression analysis is more inteded to educate policy makers and government officials on some of the benefits that increased instructional spending could be linked to, as well as for indicating some shortcomings in current drug and alcohol education.
